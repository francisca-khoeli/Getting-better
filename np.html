<h1>HOW DO YOU KNOW ITS NEGATIVE?</h1>
<img src="OIP.JPG">
<P>Negative peer pressure pushes you to the worst. </P>
<P>When you give in to peer pressure,you often feel guilty or disappointed with yourself for acting against your values.</p>

<p>Someone, either your friend or part of the group you belong to may make you feel like you have  to do something to be accepted.</p>
<p>As a result,you individually land yourself in deep sorrow and feel remorseful about the whole situation, you lose your lifestyle and entirely
adopt your peer's living.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you lose your identity surrending to peer pressure.</p>

<h2>WHAT STOPS YOU FROM SAYING NO TO PEER PRESSURE?</h2>
<p>Its not everyone who notices peer pressure towards them but for those who do, which action do they take?</p>
<p>None, only because of FEAR.</P>
<P>The fear of being rejected.People feel like saying no might destroy the relationship they have with their friends
 not realising that doing that is the best.</p>
 <p>LOW SELF-ESTEEM, this is one of the reasons one won't speak out loud about peer pressure.
 How can it be hard to say no knowing what you want and where you stand? Impossible</p>
 <p>People who lack confidence often fall for peer pressure since expressing their feelings is a challenge.</p>
 <h3>HOW CAN IT AFFECT YOU?</h3>
 
 
 <ol>
 <li>CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE</li>
 
 <p>Even if a student is fully capable of gaining a good score at school,</p>
<p> he or she can still decide to not study because peers are making studying look uncool.</p>
 <p>This affects the student's performance at school since he or she wants to fit in.</p>

 <li>SUICIDAL THOUGHTS</li>
 <P>With all the pressure and need to fit in with the rest of the peers,it is impossible for any teen to feel confident about themselves.</p>
 <p>This might lead a teen into depression,make them feel anxious and detached from their family and friends.</p>
 <p>The loneliness caused by peer pressure might push a teen to attempt self harm or worse, suicide.</p>
